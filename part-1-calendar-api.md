# [Part-1] Text to Action: API Foundation - Building a Smart Calendar AI Assistant

Link to [Blog post](https://medium.com/@vivekvells/build-a-google-calendar-api-with-express-js-7f9955caeb88)

The foundation of our "Text to Action" series starts with building a solid connection to Google Calendar's API. This module creates a simple but powerful REST API that can create events in your Google Calendar.

**Flow:** Start the server (3000) → Authenticate to create tokens.json with valid auth to securely connect to GCal API (3000/auth/google) → Request create event API endpoint with appropriate details to create the event via GCal API (/api/create-event)

## Features

- Google OAuth2 authentication
- Calendar event creation
- Simple form-based frontend interface

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up OAuth2 credentials:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Google Calendar API
   - Create OAuth2 credentials (Web application type)
   - Add <http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback> as an authorized redirect URI

4. Create a `.env` file with your OAuth2 credentials:

   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
   PORT=3000
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. First, authenticate by visiting:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/google
   ```

   The authentication flow works as follows:
   - User visits /auth/google endpoint
   - User is redirected to Google consent screen
   - After granting access, Google redirects to /auth/google/callback
   - The app stores OAuth tokens for future API calls
   - User is redirected to homepage

4. After authentication, you can create calendar events by sending a POST request to `/api/create-event` with JSON data.

## API Endpoint

### POST /api/create-event

Create a new calendar event

**Request**

```json
{
  "summary": "Team Meeting",
  "description": "Weekly team status update",
  "startDateTime": "2023-12-15T14:00:00-07:00",
  "endDateTime": "2023-12-15T15:00:00-07:00"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "eventId": "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0",
  "eventLink": "https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?eid=..."
}
```

## Testing with cURL

Create an event:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create-event \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "summary": "Team Meeting",
    "description": "Weekly team status update",
    "startDateTime": "2025-03-10T14:00:00-07:00",
    "endDateTime": "2025-03-10T15:00:00-07:00"
  }'
```

## Web Interface

A simple web interface is available at <http://localhost:3000>, which provides:

- A button to authenticate with Google
- A form to create calendar events
- Clear feedback when events are created successfully

## Security Notes

- This demo uses a simple file-based token storage system
- For production, implement more secure token storage
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints in production
